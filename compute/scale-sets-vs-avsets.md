# VM Scale Sets vs. Availability Sets

Both Availability Sets and VM Scale Sets help ensure availability, but serve different purposes.

---

## 1. Availability Sets

- Group of VMs spread across fault/update domains
- Manual deployment
- SLA up to 99.95%
- Must configure load balancer manually

### Use When:
- You need redundancy but manage VM individually

---

## 2. VM Scale Sets

- Autoscale VM groups based on rules or schedule
- Supports Azure Load Balancer and App Gateway
- Integrated with Azure Autoscale and Azure Monitor
- SLA up to 99.99% (when used with zones)

### Use When:
- Autoscaling required
- Need uniform infrastructure for stateless workloads

## 3. Comparison Table

| Feature             | Availability Set | VM Scale Set |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Redundancy Domains  | Yes              | Yes          |
| Autoscaling         | No               | Yes          |
| Load Balancer Ready | Manual           | Integrated   |
| Zone Redundant      | No               | Yes          |

## 4. Recommendation

Use **VMSS** for elastic, autoscaled services.  
Use **Availability Sets** for legacy apps or manual VM management.
